# OrinBot - An Orin Bot for Discord

Orin Bot for Discord based on Discord.NET API (https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net)

App is currently hosted on AppHarbor.

TODO List:

1. Let the bot detect github changes and messages on Discord whenever there is a pull request 
2. Play Audio sounds somehow (maybe from youtube by letting the bot have a playlist etc)
3. Make some achievements? (requires data persistence which needs to be looked up upon)
4. Detect people logging in and out, maybe even welcome them when they login
5. Image board searching (e.g. post a random picture from imagoid)
6. Allow the bot to save some data from users. (e.g. User1 pastes something into bot's memory to be retrieved sometime in the future)
7. ?

Feel free to add more on the TODO List by making a pull request.
