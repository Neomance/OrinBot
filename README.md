# OrinBot - An Orin Bot for Discord

Orin Bot for Discord based on Discord.NET API (https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net)

App is currently hosted on AppHarbor.

TODO List:

1. Let the bot detect github changes and messages on Discord whenever there is a pull request 
2. Play Audio sounds somehow (maybe from youtube by letting the bot have a playlist etc)
3. Make some achievements? (requires data persistence which needs to be looked up upon)
4. Detect people logging in and out, maybe even welcome them when they login
5. Image board searching (e.g. post a random picture from imagoid)
6. Allow the bot to save some data from users. (e.g. User1 pastes something into bot's memory to be retrieved sometime in the future)
7. In compliance to step 3, introduce leveling system that tracks activity of user when talking or in chat.
8. Allow orin to do simple math (calculation function)(orin went to kindergarden)
9. Improve responce quality by adding Bold/Italics/Underlines for better user feedback
10. Orin to pull definitions of words if needed from a thesaurus (Orin went to Highschool)
11. Orin to solve ADS questions by redisplaying old code (Orin went to University)
12. Behavioural levels of Orin bot to certain users can be done in accordance to step 7 (Orin is less polite to new people)
13. Allow the dispensions of apples when required (This may require quantum teleportation)

Feel free to add more on the TODO List by making a pull request.
